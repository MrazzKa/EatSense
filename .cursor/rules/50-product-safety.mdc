description: Release safety for TestFlight/Railway — no breaking changes, measurable checks
globs: "**/*"

RELEASE SAFETY:
- Any "release blocker" flow (auth, onboarding completion, food analysis, subscriptions) must have:
  - explicit error UI
  - telemetry log events (client + server)
  - manual QA checklist steps
- If changing auth or subscriptions:
  - preserve backward compatibility for existing users
  - add migration steps if needed
- Provide rollback plan (what to revert, env toggles/flags if available).
